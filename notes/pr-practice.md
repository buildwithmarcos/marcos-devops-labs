# PR Practice Note

This file was created on branch `feature/pr-practice-clean`
to practice a clean Pull Request workflow.

## ✅ PR Workflow I Practiced

- [x] Start from `main` and pull latest changes  
- [x] Create a new feature branch for the change  
- [x] Make a small, focused update to the code or notes  
- [x] Stage the change using `git add`  
- [x] Commit with a clear, descriptive message  
- [x] Push the branch to GitHub with `git push -u origin <branch>`  
- [x] Open a Pull Request (`feature/...` → `main`)  
- [x] Review the diff under **Files changed**  
- [x] Merge the PR using "Merge pull request"  
- [x] Delete the remote branch after merge  
- [x] Switch back to `main` locally & pull the new changes  
- [x] Delete the local feature branch

### 🧠 What this taught me

- Branching keeps main clean and protected  
- PRs make changes reviewable and trackable  
- Small commits are easier to merge and debug  
- Keeping `main` up-to-date prevents conflicts  
- A clean PR workflow is the foundation of DevOps collaboration
